## Install Ant Design

1. First, you need to install the Ant Design core library and the related style dependencies:

```bash
npm install antd
```

2. Install Ant Design Icons (Optional)

If you plan to use icons (like in the login form for username/password icons), you should also install the @ant-design/icons package:

```bash
npm install @ant-design/icons
```

3. Import Ant Design Styles
   You need to import the Ant Design styles (CSS) globally in your project. Typically, you would add this in your main entry file (e.g., index.tsx or App.tsx):

```bash
import 'antd/dist/reset.css';
```
